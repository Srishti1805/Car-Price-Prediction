## Car-Price-Prediction

## Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of cars using a dataset. The steps include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. The model used is a Random Forest Regressor, and the final model is saved using the pickle library.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is car data.csv, which contains various features related to cars, such as year of manufacture, selling price, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and number of previous owners.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn
Seaborn
Matplotlib

## How to Run
Ensure all dependencies are installed.
Place the dataset (car data.csv) in the same directory as the script.
Run the script (python app.py) to preprocess the data, train the model, and save the model to a file.
